# React Assignment 8

Create an application having tabs with three options
1) Dashboard
2) Forces
3) Crime Categories

Details:
-----------
1) DASHBOARD: Leave it empty for now
2) FORCES: Fetch data from this API: https://data.police.uk/api/forces and render all the fields. Allow user to search by name SERIALLY.
3) CRIME CATEGORIES: Fetch data from this API: https://data.police.uk/api/crime-categories and render all the fields. Allow user to search by name SERIALLY.


For Tabs, you can use any library.
Don't forget to comment the functional things except the render function.
Don't forget to deploy and share the link.
